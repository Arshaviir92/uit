	<p class="f">Hello, I am ten years old and I want to start this job with motivation. This is my portfolio. I started this a few months ago. I know this happened quickly, but I've been going into this for ten years and I want to make sure I know what I'm doing. But I always have despairing thoughts, but maybe this will shape my future. And in these few months I will explain my work on this site. I remember the first day I was excited and I remember that I had put two words and a photo on my site and I was very happy in general, but now that I think about it, I see that I did very little work, maybe because at that time I didn't know anything. It was a good step, and now I know that if my work becomes too big, I will laugh at it now, but until then, I will try because this is my dream.And I will not stop doing this unless I am gone or something happensBut I know that I may be disappointed one day, but the next days I will try harder and if I try hard, I can probably succeed.in twenty yearsIf I try harder and learn more things, unless I get more opportunities, but in that case, I will not give up.
